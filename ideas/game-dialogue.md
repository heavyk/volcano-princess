### 2029-09-29 19:41 - dialogue thoughts

this idea was conceived with little-nursery in mind, but could easily be adapted to fit volcano-princess as well. as an example, in volcano-princess, one question that was asked me is, "why is asbel so determined to kill all the magical monsters" (something like that) -- and the answers are answers that I never would have thought up which throughly confused me. later on, I thought about it and decided that (without knowing too much of the story yet), I'd have to assume that asbel is trying to prove himself (to himself, or to others, I'm not sure yet because I've not really talked to him).
now, later on I was thinking about how I'd do dialogue for little-nursury, and I decided that I want to have all of the answers, not in a list, but arranged like 2d points on a grid. so, for example (I don't know if I can remember it):

```
(*)
he's doing it for the money


                                    (*)
    it's part of the process of establishing and maintaining power


  (*)
it's his duty(?)

```

so then, what I do is I can place a marker that is close to one of the dots but not all the way on the dot... because, for example I don't personally know about any of those. I simply cannot say for sure cause I don't know him the storyline too well -- and also my "safe" answer of "he's trying to prove himself" (which is almost always going to be true) isn't there.
  it's almost always true, because the only exception will be a person that has very low resistance, and so if the magical monsters have a strong fear or expectation that asbel is going to relentlessly pursue them until death, then asbel will we strongly influenced to fulfil their desire/fear. I find it very unlikely that asbel is this type of person, so safely I can always say he's trying to prove himself.
    why is he proving himself? desire appears in many forms, and the motivating factor can be any number of things: society, friends, expectations, norms, etc. -- or it could be just because I really wanted to do it. usually it's an external motivation though, and not internal (non-resistant pure-desire) and whenever it's external, he's proving himself to society, friends, their expectations, their ideals, and their desired implementation.
    proving oneself is always 2nd ray perception, because it originates primarily in the brain. when releasing all of those mental restrants that determine me desire for m5, all of my non-resistant 2nd ray percception (provided by the sun) is able to get through. be like the sun, and just stop proving yourself -- is my advise.

what ends up happening, within this layout, is to forces me to think about how closely aligned to each of these symbolic answers -- and another thing that I think could be cool would be to paint a color of perceived truthyness -- cause I don't know, may not have been paying attention, or I clicked through the dialoge too fast by accident.
the other thing I like about it, is let's say one point gives +10 EMO and the other +10 INT -- well, if I pick a point between the two, then I can get +5 of each. this allows my character to be more "well rounded"

### 2023-09-29 11:11 - forward/backward, and complete narrative

as I go through selecting, I want to be able to go back and redo the previous one a different way. then, at the end (also to be able to save it), it'd be cool to see a replay of the whole thing with all of my previous selected dialogues, said and thought.
