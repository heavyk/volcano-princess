# little-nursery

for unknown reasons, the majority of adults all over town have seemingly disappeared, leaving a population of majority youth. it was clear that with so many left without parents, a number of adults in the town setup nursuries for the children.

ideas on the foundations of how I would teach, or not teach them and what activities to perform around the day.

this project is a complete joke to me because without an aspect of how one feels, the nursury will turn into quite the scandal.

anyway, the real treasure of this game is figuring out how to cultivate the aspects they want to discover in the children in their nursery. like, some will want business attributes, and others for physical traits and attributes -- but there are some really interesting concepts to be discoveredd in the interactions. I believe the game itself will teach behavioural awareness to where one can "know" what the other person "is" by the action they're performing.

expansion packs include more parents disappear, but the new kids come with new attributes (and of course those that don't have the attribute, can perform the steps necessary by better and better at the conceptual requirements). this is endless... somehow...
