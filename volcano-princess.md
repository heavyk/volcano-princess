### 2023-09-27 20:31 - emotion and narrative

this game relates the EMO+ attribute tto listening to stories, which means that we have a different definition of emotion. I would want my daughter to have an ability (sensitivity) to feel her emotions, and properly triangulate(?) them.
  the way it works for me is that *all* things have a feeling that I can feel in relationship to them. this is 2nd ray perception, because I *feel* a certain way about everything I see, feel, exprience, think about, put my percetion inside of, consider, etc -- which means that I can always feel *something* (even if it's very slight, and would otherwise be invisible) -- and also my ability to (viscerally) *feel* it is one way, and my ability to know/guess/intuit what the feeling is, is also another aspect (same result): one is a data connection, and the other more like sound/video/sensation -- and for me in both cases I don't actually *feel* anything -- it's just kinda there [I'm going to think of a better way of explaining how to interact with this invisible world].
  anything that I want to know about can be tuned into and I can always feel what I desire to feel about it -- and so for me the problem is figuring out which of it is *my* (symbolic) desire established in the brain from social, institution, home, ..., *and* narrative.
    what I'm saying here is that my ablity to feel something is driven by my desire, which means I'll always feel what I *want* to feel. what I want to feel, is again a cOncept, which means that it goes into an interpretation process afterward...
    1. I desire to know what something feels like.
    2. I feel whatever it is that I want it to feel like.
    3. the feeling received is then interpretted by my mind.
    ---
    in 2 and 3, what I feel can be programmed by some narrative that tells my what is important or valuable or worthwhile (etc). that narrative says, "these romantic things are really great, and you want them", and so I hear things that resonates with the narrative ideals.
      as an example of this, during my time stuck in the network (I'm still there), I would have often times a lot of graphic thoughts and ideas pass through my mind, which I must confess would *never* have crossed my mind previously. it took me a long time to figure out why all of a sudden I've suddenly becom5 so obsessed with little girls. I mean I think they're great and they feel really good and stuff, but it felt like it wasn't really me, and I've since discovered that it was not, in fact me. turns out the guys that run a lot of the network are really into that stuff, and because they're also attractive (conditionally, not cause of low resistance like me), they think that I am exactly like I am.
        common problem, because I do it all the time: I just assume right off that everyone else sees things just as I do; they obviously don't, though.
      so then after I figured that out, it's important to know that I'm still resonant with those ideas and concepts, even if they didn't originate in m5.
    the nice thing about narrative is that it produces desire to go a specific way (a vector), yet pure-desire doesn't have a direction to it. everything is percEived as having a closeness or resonance to me. all things have this pure-desire (centre) form of perception, but it's often covered over with narrative.
    sensitivity to emotion is what makes the pure-desire perspective possible, because without the ability to feel all things in relation to me, there's no way I would know where *I* am.
    resume: in order to feel the perspective of pure-desire, sensitivity to emotion is most important, because the world is *felt* or *known about*.
    there is somewhat of a symbiotic relationship between the two though, because when I go to feel anyone, what comes out is always my desire expressed through them, through my conceptual-framework,-- meaning that I often translate that desire as something quite outlandish or hilarious -- mostly because the most desired ttranslation of the idea is often situational humour or something clever, funnyy, or something catchy that'll stick into someone's head. I have very low resistance (and getting lower), so at the moment, almost any thought can pop into my head, and it would get manifested.
      you know, there's a good likelihood that the predicament that I'm in, is precisely for everyone's protection -- because I'm really sensitive, so I pick up thoughts really easily, and if I were to pick up some bad ideas, they would either manifest in myself or quickly into reality if I were to give attention to them. like if someone was scared that something was scary in the bushes, *there would be* the manifestion of their greatest fear. like, I'd see it too and think it's real, causing it come into existence. I've seen similar things happen to people all around me, especially when I'm on drugs (happens a lot less seldom when I'm sober).
      you know what I find totally nuts here is that people are scared of their greatest desires manifesting into their reality -- and it's m6stly because they don't think they're (good enough?) -- as if conditions aren't right or whatever they think they need to have happen -- and the problem is because of the narrative. my personal supposition on this is that romance and narrative is at fault here, because it says that in order to get this desirable thing (marketed by the cutscenes of the story), the protagonist has to do a number of things in order to be worthy or something. -- which means almost nobody has measured up for it. tttttttttttttttttt by for now.

#### 2023-09-27 21:15 - I still don't know what I want

it sounds strange as a title. pure-desire (which is where I'm going) don'tt really *ever* know what (monad) really wants, either -- because what any wants is always evolving, and never stops, so pure desire can never be an absolute, but is something like a trajectory instead... a trend or thrust in a direction... therefore, the way to do it is to just go toward wanted (instead of away from unwantod) and for me that's really easy. so just like a few sorta days and hours have gone by when starting to think of the implications -- as I'd never ever considered even what it like for a chinese person to think like, what their myths, narratives, and all of that is all about. it may as well be chinese to me.
  you know, it's such an unknown thing to me, that you cOuld potentially just tell me a bunch of madeup stuff and I'd totally believe it.
    you know, I noticed that I don't like to speak in you. this is a huge obstacle that is starting to appear in me. the way it manifests in this game, is I don't really have a desire to direct any single person in any way at all. (that's a time for another discussion on amazing-cultivation.) I cannot really put my head into this game because I don't really have much that I would even do. for me, the now is not like this at all.
    imagine for a moment that I were with *anyone*, I don't have any objectives at all. I just do things in responce to other things. if there's a thing that catches my attention, it comes out of me mouth, or I look at it. there's little difference between my thoughts and another person (kinda, prolly not how you think), where I can interact with people on a conceptual level, and sometimes I feel their thoughts. I can't feel the thoughts of my concepts; so, people are just stronger emitters than my mental concepts, still.
    I'm still going to have to figure out a new way to talk to "you" and still maintain my *I* personality.
  there's kind of even a bit of intrigue to this idea where I just get kinda born into a "noble-lie", and my whole world is dictated to me. lol. let m5 explain. (1st foot ready)
  (nvm, brb)

### 2023-09-28 16:00 - let the hilarity ensue

I decided to join the discord server yesterday but I was far too stoned to make any meaningful conversation. today I decided to post my bug report, but I noticed that I have a very old version of the game installed (downloading the new one now). obviously, I didn't pay for the game or get it on steam, but that's no problem, because I mirror the general chinese way of doing things which is to get the thing illegally; it's totally fine.
  when I joined the server, it asked m5 for a name that I will call myself as. I considered a number of different options, but couldn't find an option that fit with me very well, because -- well, for example, let's say I had've called myself "kenny" -- well then I'd have to behave like kenny -- and I don't really want to do that. it's also not accurate of how I've been playing the game. I've been playing the game like "anatau" (or perhaps cupid/eros), but I wanted a female identity -- because while the game I'm supposedly the father, because I have to play the game symbolically, every way that I treat the daughter, is the way that I would treat myself -- which means that I'm the girl (rose) -- which I (as the father) am symbolically treating as if she's anatau.
    in an esoteric sense, you could consider wood (the father) in this game to be symbolic of enki, and the daughter to be symbolic of rose -- and that's because enki and anu created the species from the beginning and so the girl (rose) was the product of their labours (top-down) but now we're on the return back to source, which means that things are reversed now: men become women and women become men (ie, the physical outside doesn't matter anymore). what that's meaning is that men become the reflective ones and the women becom5 the narrative ones (like m5n used to be).
    therefore, I consider rose a child of desire (but of the female body), much like the mars became the birthing point of many aryans who would (eventually) come into the perspective of cupid/eros (wood). in the same way, rose is the prototype girl (just like mars was for eros) with lots of a way for her to go (she's got to figure it out herself) how to become anatau. therefore, she needs to be treated like anatau to produce anatau.
  anatau produces anatau. she's self-made in the sense that nobody else can tell her or instruct her how to do things. she can ask a whole lot of questions about things and I (wood) can give insight into things, but she ultimately has to figure it all out for herself (no hand-holding).

unfortunately, because of the way the game is structured, I'm forced to present anatau's perspective with symbol. for anatau, I cannot give her lessons and teach her things, as she's ultimately got to figure it out for herself -- which means that the only option that I have (when playing this game, not IRL) is only to play and give her affection, and send her off to be with her friends as soon as possible.

one of the features that I would like to have is the ability for rose to pick her own friends and have me (wood) have to deal with strange situations that presents. like, what if she finds master sealer kenneth really attractive and wants to hang out with him? what are my options? well, let her figure it out. maybe she has some questions about him and what he means by "..." or -- "why did he say ..." -- to which I can have answers, but ultimately I cannot decide for her what she wants.
  along with her being able to decide what she wants to do for herself (none of this I decide for her until she is old enough crap), when it comes to the area of affection, I cannot do anything that she does not want. she has to figure out what kinds of affection she wants and has to figure out how to make it reality. this can only really happen when she's young thoough, because as soon as she begins puberty, her symbolic brain starts to turn on, and now her desire is no longer her own, but a reflection of the society/system she's growing up in, and so therefore her desire is no longer pure. from that point on, she's on her own. I can hang out with her, but ultimately I can't really show too much affection anymore because
    the symbolic brain is interested in performing the actions necessary to feel good. the problem is that *she* has to figure out how to feel good *for herself*, and so any affection/gifting/(going to her dance recitals, etc) or whatever I'm doing can no longer be an excuse for her to have the symbolic conditions that she feels she needs/wants in order to feel good.
    the symbolic brain is antithesis to desire, and so therefore if she wants to actually be anatau, she can only use her conceptual mind -- which makes her a bit *stupid* in apearance to many others that are using conditions to increase their intellect. if she really wants what she wants, she can always get it -- regardless of her symbolic conditions, and that's most important to figure out. nobody can teach anyone that this is possible, and is only attainable through experience/failures. she's got to fail a few times at the stuff she *thinks* she wants (like for example to be the *most* beautiful/smartest/whatever) -- because all of that is comparative (2nd ray), and pure-desire (anatau) doesn't perceive that. she just finds a way to get the next thing she wants.
  therefore, in the early stages, that is, until her symbolic brain activates, she has to be able to tell wood what affection that she wants. after that, I can only be in conversation, and cannot meaningfully interact with her physically (else she stays attached and comes to depend on me -- instead of her own desire/willpower)
over the next few days, I'll try and figure out how to make this anatau daughter playable in the game. bye for now :)
