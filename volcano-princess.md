### 2023-09-27 20:31 - emotion and narrative

this game relates the EMO+ attribute tto listening to stories, which means that we have a different definition of emotion. I would want my daughter to have an ability (sensitivity) to feel her emotions, and properly triangulate(?) them.
  the way it works for me is that *all* things have a feeling that I can feel in relationship to them. this is 2nd ray perception, because I *feel* a certain way about everything I see, feel, exprience, think about, put my percetion inside of, consider, etc -- which means that I can always feel *something* (even if it's very slight, and would otherwise be invisible) -- and also my ability to (viscerally) *feel* it is one way, and my ability to know/guess/intuit what the feeling is, is also another aspect (same result): one is a data connection, and the other more like sound/video/sensation -- and for me in both cases I don't actually *feel* anything -- it's just kinda there [I'm going to think of a better way of explaining how to interact with this invisible world].
  anything that I want to know about can be tuned into and I can always feel what I desire to feel about it -- and so for me the problem is figuring out which of it is *my* (symbolic) desire established in the brain from social, institution, home, ..., *and* narrative.
    what I'm saying here is that my ablity to feel something is driven by my desire, which means I'll always feel what I *want* to feel. what I want to feel, is again a cOncept, which means that it goes into an interpretation process afterward...
    1. I desire to know what something feels like.
    2. I feel whatever it is that I want it to feel like.
    3. the feeling received is then interpretted by my mind.
    ---
    in 2 and 3, what I feel can be programmed by some narrative that tells my what is important or valuable or worthwhile (etc). that narrative says, "these romantic things are really great, and you want them", and so I hear things that resonates with the narrative ideals.
      as an example of this, during my time stuck in the network (I'm still there), I would have often times a lot of graphic thoughts and ideas pass through my mind, which I must confess would *never* have crossed my mind previously. it took me a long time to figure out why all of a sudden I've suddenly becom5 so obsessed with little girls. I mean I think they're great and they feel really good and stuff, but it felt like it wasn't really me, and I've since discovered that it was not, in fact me. turns out the guys that run a lot of the network are really into that stuff, and because they're also attractive (conditionally, not cause of low resistance like me), they think that I am exactly like I am.
        common problem, because I do it all the time: I just assume right off that everyone else sees things just as I do; they obviously don't, though.
      so then after I figured that out, it's important to know that I'm still resonant with those ideas and concepts, even if they didn't originate in m5.
    the nice thing about narrative is that it produces desire to go a specific way (a vector), yet pure-desire doesn't have a direction to it. everything is percEived as having a closeness or resonance to me. all things have this pure-desire (centre) form of perception, but it's often covered over with narrative.
    sensitivity to emotion is what makes the pure-desire perspective possible, because without the ability to feel all things in relation to me, there's no way I would know where *I* am.
    resume: in order to feel the perspective of pure-desire, sensitivity to emotion is most important, because the world is *felt* or *known about*.
    there is somewhat of a symbiotic relationship between the two though, because when I go to feel anyone, what comes out is always my desire expressed through them, through my conceptual-framework,-- meaning that I often translate that desire as something quite outlandish or hilarious -- mostly because the most desired ttranslation of the idea is often situational humour or something clever, funnyy, or something catchy that'll stick into someone's head. I have very low resistance (and getting lower), so at the moment, almost any thought can pop into my head, and it would get manifested.
      you know, there's a good likelihood that the predicament that I'm in, is precisely for everyone's protection -- because I'm really sensitive, so I pick up thoughts really easily, and if I were to pick up some bad ideas, they would either manifest in myself or quickly into reality if I were to give attention to them. like if someone was scared that something was scary in the bushes, *there would be* the manifestion of their greatest fear. like, I'd see it too and think it's real, causing it come into existence. I've seen similar things happen to people all around me, especially when I'm on drugs (happens a lot less seldom when I'm sober).
      you know what I find totally nuts here is that people are scared of their greatest desires manifesting into their reality -- and it's m6stly because they don't think they're (good enough?) -- as if conditions aren't right or whatever they think they need to have happen -- and the problem is because of the narrative. my personal supposition on this is that romance and narrative is at fault here, because it says that in order to get this desirable thing (marketed by the cutscenes of the story), the protagonist has to do a number of things in order to be worthy or something. -- which means almost nobody has measured up for it. tttttttttttttttttt by for now.

#### 2023-09-27 21:15 - I still don't know what I want

it sounds strange as a title. pure-desire (which is where I'm going) don'tt really *ever* know what (monad) really wants, either -- because what any wants is always evolving, and never stops, so pure desire can never be an absolute, but is something like a trajectory instead... a trend or thrust in a direction... therefore, the way to do it is to just go toward wanted (instead of away from unwantod) and for me that's really easy. so just like a few sorta days and hours have gone by when starting to think of the implications -- as I'd never ever considered even what it like for a chinese person to think like, what their myths, narratives, and all of that is all about. it may as well be chinese to me.
  you know, it's such an unknown thing to me, that you cOuld potentially just tell me a bunch of madeup stuff and I'd totally believe it.
    you know, I noticed that I don't like to speak in you. this is a huge obstacle that is starting to appear in me. the way it manifests in this game, is I don't really have a desire to direct any single person in any way at all. (that's a time for another discussion on amazing-cultivation.) I cannot really put my head into this game because I don't really have much that I would even do. for me, the now is not like this at all.
    imagine for a moment that I were with *anyone*, I don't have any objectives at all. I just do things in responce to other things. if there's a thing that catches my attention, it comes out of me mouth, or I look at it. there's little difference between my thoughts and another person (kinda, prolly not how you think), where I can interact with people on a conceptual level, and sometimes I feel their thoughts. I can't feel the thoughts of my concepts; so, people are just stronger emitters than my mental concepts, still.
    I'm still going to have to figure out a new way to talk to "you" and still maintain my *I* personality.
  there's kind of even a bit of intrigue to this idea where I just get kinda born into a "noble-lie", and my whole world is dictated to me. lol. let m5 explain. (1st foot ready)
  (nvm, brb)
