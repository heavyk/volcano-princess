### 2023-09-27 4:30 - initial thoughts on mass-scale production (on the galactic scale)

this game is notably 1st person perspective -- which is really jarring for me, because I exist in any time or space I want to be in (cause it's all tuning).
  I can tune into any thing in any place in time because I'm tuning in to my concept of it.
    that means I define what it is that I'm perceiving (ie, where the borders/barriers are drawn). I say (example) I'm perceing feeling this thing, and it is in the container of whatever shape it's in -- like a crab has the shape of a crab, and a fish, a fish. each shaped by where my brain interprets the barrier between differently rotating surfaces -- like a medium (for exameple troposphere, ionosphere).
    so if I want to feel a plant, I can feel the plant -- or I can feel the Plant (which would be like the species or grouping of similarly vibrating things, share a relative centre -- like a star cluster or gas cloud) and that Plant has a feeling to them, just like a human does.. I can then tune into the Plant -- and feel its perspective/relation in comparison to another thing.
      there are levels to the the perception -- where one could be physical pain/hunger/etc, versus mental pain/hunger/etc -- but around the time I get to conceptual level of perception, there's not really any pain or strife or any of that anymore. everything feels pretty good there and I can just get ideas out of the way they feel (and are talking) that is far beyond their capacity to receive it. it would be a very very high frequency concept that I'm able to perceive conceptually.
        the phyiscal+conceptual realm has lower and lower frequency cOnecepts that eventually become the things that we call atoms (which resonate with the earth). it's all just a vibration that manifests itself in many invisible ways before finally turning into a lump of atoms.
      one level is in the most visceral of physical, and the other is the gentle motion of the emotional world, where concepts exist in clusters and groups (not restrained by dimensions) -- and so fourth. any perception into any of these concepts are translated in the relative-brain as a comparison (always against ME).
        the ME is the physical vibration compiled/manifested DNA -- of a conceptual framework, entirely mental. anyway...
  I think at this point I want to remind myself of the notion that *I* set the boundaries/barriers between things. my brain (has in a very tiny frequencies) an inner image of all of my world around me, and where these different barriers coming from a sort of flowing thing -- probably that chi stuff cause it's like a fluid --
    the way that I define this is that the very dark star that is earth has a bunch of stuff coming out of it. that energy hits earth's (dense) physical plane and gets converted into a sort of structural energy -- something like the mineral kingdom, and then bubbles up to the next more advanced structure, up through all forms of DNA, etc. I've heard that stuff (the 1st ray energy) is coming from the planet. the chi stuff is coming from the sun.
      the way I look at this is (not 100% sure) that the sun is outputting 2nd ray energy -- and I suppose that's the case because the sun has a whole lot of attraction vorticies in on itself which sends out a duality because it's a thing that escaped the attraction of another, and so has a sort of twist to it. the sun twists a lot more than say an incandescent bulb or even carbon lamp. that twisting suggests to me that it's 2nd ray.
      it *could* also be saturn (4th ray energy) -- but that's the earth, not the sun.
      the way that chi (2) is captured by our planet passes through a massively symbolic matrix of everything down to physical, and in the process of passing through it, it creates a resonant frequency in the conceptual realm, because I've noticed that the sun kinda feels the way that I think about reality (sometimes) -- so there's at least a strong correlation. at any rate, the way to interacting with anything in space and time can be done using concepts. I just tune into (receive) the information I want to about a thing by translating that concept into a thought -- and if the symbolic thought translation still resonates with the concept, then the translation is good. any emotional dissonance I experience with my translation means the translation isn't very accurate (protocol error, but also means I'm overreacting too).
        learning how to see things in a way which pleases/displeases/upsets/excites, is eventually the new reality we'll live in: each one of us with our own slant on reality: I see that same idea a bit differently than they do (and they're of course the ones that are doing wrong). the benefit to that form of perception means that everyone will be able to feel as good or as bad as they want to on any set of concepts, and adjust as they see fit. the side benefit is that anyone can learn to feel a range of good or bad on any topic.
  as chi-2 comes nearer and nearer to earth, I notice that it turns into a lot of concepts, all the way down to the physical where it turns into atoms and stuff. it's like raining minerals.
  another interesting one is what I'd suppose is like the ionosphere where those are like a very high density of very high frequency concepts -- a sort of fluid of ideals and symbolic desiress.
  each of these layers that the sun's energy gets slowed down into resonant wave patterns (cause remember these waves are 3d), it produces all sorts of interesting stuff.
  another very interesting one is perhaps where the earth and the sun's energies collide; a tension. coming in from the sun is a 2nd ray framework of all of our concepts and ideals mixed into one (like every creature, or being's the-manual) -- and that meets with the earth's pure-desire energy, meaning that higher frequency stuff (ie, 1st ray) is *always* more attractive.
    we're literally living in a constant tension where there is an attractive force (the centre of earth), and there's another emissive force coming from the sun. there's that structural stuff and stuff like that, ...
