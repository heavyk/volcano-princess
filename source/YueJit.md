# YueJit

### 2023-11-26 20:07 - initial thoughts

today I felt like I wanted to look at my email, and actually to my surprise, jin had emailed me back -- and quite positively too. I blelive I had checked my email at least once since I sent out the email, but apparently I hadn't; and it'd already been 8 days since then. I'm actually quite surprised. I don't feel any problems about the delayed response on my part, but I did notice quite a few changes that have happened in the last 30m since I read her reply... they are the following: I tuned into her, and I notice that my brain no longer feels the same surity that I normally have -- like, for example she said about "beating" LuaJIT (or just doing it for fun) -- but I thought in full seriousness, "I don't think I can beat mike (pall)". his code is like really good, and he knows like really a lot more about microprocessors than I do (and stuff). I really don't consider myself to be a super duper programmer in any way. I just know I can figure stuff out and am confident in that -- and that's the main thing that's left me the last few minutes or so. I'll prolly get it back pretty soon, so it's no worries, but instead I'm saying this to express the reality of my nature, which is to reflect the people that I'm coming into contact with.
    you know, this is a question that I've had the last few months or so (since I started playing chinese games, starting with volcano-princess and immortal-mayor), which is why -- if these things that most of us struggle at come so effortless to them, like skinning and animating hundreds of models or writing incredibly complicated code (as if they see the whole codebase at once) -- why don't they just take over the world or something -- like they have all the skills, technology, and everything that they would need to fully make everything a reflection of their creativity, yet they just stick to making simple microwave ovens and stuff like that. it seems to me like they can catch on to patterns really easily and replicate them, so why aren't they reflecting western culture and trying to become dominant? why not just replicate western ideas and do them better and cheaper than westerners can.
        (before I write my hypothesis) personally, for me, I have to say that I constantly struggle with becoming a reflection of western ideas. I grew up with machineguns and g.i. joes, but that faded the more I found out about technology and all the cool stuff that can be done with it. because I'm american though, all of my desire to create better and easier to use things, appears (because of the reflection) like I'm constantly wanting to take over the world -- as if I'm scheming to become dominant, when in fact I want nothing of domination; I only like that things go easy and smoothe, so often times in my efforts to have things go easier, it appears that I'm dictating how it should be (this makes me look a bit bossy to others, I've noticed). I live in a very symbolic society, and it's hard for them to conceive that I just want to make cool stuff, as they're all looking from the mutual-back-scratching perspective where I have an ulterior motive to what I'm doing, to get some kind of personal benefit for myself (I am pretty selfish). it created a struggle at first, because I didn't want to *appear* like they did being selfish, so I would refrain from doing anything that would give the *appearance* to anyone that I'm selfish. I got over that eventually though and now I'm fine being fully selfish, because I actually like me more than they like theirselves. what I'm saying is, a lot of western ideals (even the questionable ones) are actually not all that bad at all when pictured from a creativity and desire perspective. as an example, if I were to do something for someone else (something that's considered "good"), I'm usually hindering them by making them feel better when it's their job to make them feel better, not mine. we have a lot of social expectations that strongly disempower everyone -- like for example titles, and age minimums, and other prerequisites and conditions which we say must be met before something (conditionals). our society runs like a computer program, but the "bad-guys", don't follow the rules though -- they do what they want to do, which is often times outside of the rules and conditions (bad), so it's looked down upon to actually "break the rules" -- but that's a false dialectic to begin with, because I'm not "breaking the rules" if I'm doing what I want to do -- because what I want to do (from a creativity/desire perspective) is actually in the highest/greatest good of everyone else, too (pure-desire always is). so I tend to embrace a whole lot of what the west views as "bad" and actually kinda shun the stuff they think is "good".
    what I believe is happening with the chinese actually is a serious case of "not good enough" -- and it's because of a lack of identity. symbolic people -- and the more symbolic they are -- are very *notable and defined*; they have an identity to them which makes them unique and different from the rest. each one of us is a character in the play, and the play wouldn't be any good if everyone looked the same, sounded the same, played all the same 4-5 parts, etc. -- so that lack of identity manifests itself as not-good-enoughness, because I'm not all that different from the next guy, and (s)he isn't doing that cool thing either -- cept the kings and rulers, because they look different, because they have a symbolic status and presense about them that says they're different. (that's probably a good way to summarise the feeling I wrote about earlier when I had my doubts about beating mike, actually).
I'm actually quite excited to begin this venture of making YueJIT, because I'm going to kinda like absorb their culture in all ways, and it'll make an amalgamation of me, but coming from the perspective of their culture. I anticipate many more moments when I'm suddenly thinking about things from a perspective that is not my own, and I'll find a way to get back to my "usual" way of thinking, which is very selfish, egotistical, and quite optimistic. it's going to be really fun. bye for now! I'm gonna go recover my ego and figure this next part out :) happy reflections!
